#### Description:

Dragon Block Breaker is a video game made in Unity.

It is an arkanoid like block breaking video game with a couple extra features.

You can rotate the paddle slightly to the left and right to give you a bit more control over where the ball goes.

There is also a rhythm game like element where if you press space as the ball hits the paddle, you build up your power meter.

Once the meter is full, you can activate it to have your ball do double damage.

The game also times you to see how long it takes for you to finish it, it is quite hard as there are no extra lives and the ball can get quite quick. This is a feature, not a bug.



This is my first time making a video game, hence why it looks so bad. I made some of the art, but there are some pre-made assets that I used.

It is actually a lot harder to make a game than I thought it would be, and it took a lot longer to make this than what it looks like.
 There are so many components to making a game, like the audio, VFX and art, that the coding aspect was probably one of the easier parts, as the rest of the CS50 course helped out with that.
