You nervously knock on the old oak door, hearing rustling behind it once you do.
A lock clicks and the door swings opens, dust flies out and an old man in a robe and a great white beard peers at you from a dimly lit room.

The burrowed frown on the mans face quickly changes to a bright smile, "You must be my new apprentice!" he exclaims, his face grinning and showing a few silver teeth.
"Come in, come in", he beckons you into the room, in the centre, towards the back, there's a large bench with various magical apparatus scattered on it, there are also bookshelves filled with ancient looking books,
and in the corner, there's a small fire pit with a cauldron, the fire isn't burning and the cauldron looks empty right now. There is also a corridor near the cauldron, but you can't see where it leads off to.

The wizard says "I'm sure you are eager to start learning, I will be back in a jiffy to get you a beginner tome and wand! I am conducting important research, so make sure to not touch ANYTHING!!!"
The wizard then goes off through the corridor, you hear a door creak open further down and then a loud slam as it closes.

You are now left in the room by yourself, what do you do?

1. Sit tight and wait for the wizard to come back
2. Have a look at the desk
3. Follow the wizard down the corridor
