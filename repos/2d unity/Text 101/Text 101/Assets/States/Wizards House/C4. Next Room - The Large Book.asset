  storyText: 'You decide to have a look at the open book, it looks like a compendium
    of rare and dangerous monsters. The page it''s currently on is about a monster
    called the Merlucent, which is a jellyfish-like humanoid that has the ability
    to transport prey and itself to a pocket dimension.

    

    The pocket dimension
    occupies the same physical space as the material world, and it can be easily
    accessed with a spell if there is a Merlucent nearby.

    

    The book also
    mentions that they like to hunt creatures with large amounts of magic

    

    You
    feel as if someone is watching you

    

    What do you do?
