  storyText: 'You nervously knock on the old oak door, hearing rustling behind it
    once you do.

    A lock clicks and the door swings opens, dust flies out and
    an old man in a robe and a great white beard peers at you from a dimly lit room.



    The
    burrowed frown on the mans face quickly changes to a bright smile, "You must
    be my new apprentice!" he exclaims, his face grinning and showing a few silver
    teeth.

    "Come in, come in", he beckons you into the room, in the centre,
    towards the back, there''s a large bench with various magical apparatus scattered
    on it, there are also bookshelves filled with ancient looking books,

    and
    in the corner, there''s a small fire pit with a cauldron, the fire isn''t burning
    and the cauldron looks empty right now. There is also a corridor near the cauldron,
    but you can''t see where it leads off to.



    The wizard says "I''m sure you
    are eager to start learning, I will be back in a jiffy to get you a beginner
    tome and wand! I am conducting important research, so make sure to not touch
    ANYTHING!!!"

    The wizard then goes off through the corridor, you hear a door
    creak open further down and then a loud slam as it closes.



    You are now
    left in the room by yourself, what do you do?



    1. Sit tight and wait for
    the wizard to come back

    2. Have a look at the desk

    3. Follow the wizard
    down the corridor '
