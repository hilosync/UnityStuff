  storyText: 'As you start reciting the spell, you are surrounded in a flash of light,
    when you finish, you see yourself in the same room but everything is covered
    in slime.


    You also see the Merlucent in the room, it is much larger and
    more intimidating than the picture in the book. It looks to be holding a vaguely
    human-shaped blob of jelly


    What do you do?


    1. Call out to the Merlucent



    2.
    Use the wand to cast a fire spell'
