  storyText: 'You call out to the monster and get its attention, unfortunately for
    you, it is extremely aggressive and attacks you immediately.

    

    

    

    You
    dodge the first shot of slime it throws out, but the second catches your legs
    and immobilizes you.

    

    

    

    As you get hit with more blobs
    of slime, they slowly encapsulate you until they block your vision and you slowly
    lose consciesness.
