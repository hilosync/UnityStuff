  storyText: "You start to dig the slime out, there's a lot of it but you quickly
    start to notice parts of a human.\r It's the wizard, thankfully he is alive but
    unconscious.\r You shake him awake, and with a gasped breath he yells out \"WHAT
    HAPPENED??!?!?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou tell him that the Merlucent he had in his
    cage must have somehow escaped and taken him by surprise.  And that you defeated
    it using this wand you found.\r The wizard looks at you, in shock, \"If you did
    all that as an apprentice, then you must be one of the most promising wizards
    in history\" he says.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou both leave the pocket dimension, and
    he tells you to go home for the rest of the day, and that you'll start doing
    more advanced magic from tomorrow onwards \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe End\n\nPress 1
